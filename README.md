## Welcome to the CMS CodeBook Demo

This site is a demo to show how a PDF Codebook can be converted to HTML using the [IDR JPDF2HTML5 Online Converter](https://www.idrsolutions.com/online-pdf-to-html5-converter/). The html pages generated by the Converter are then run through the html_labeler process to create html files that are named according to the fieldname in the codebook that they are describing.

The purpose of this demo is to provide a landing place for the CMS Blue Button API to describe field values in the FHIR resources that are made available via the API.
