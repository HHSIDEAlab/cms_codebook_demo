<h2>Welcome to the CMS CodeBook Demo</h2>

<p>This site is a demo to show how a PDF Codebook can be converted to HTML using the IDR JPDF2HTML5 Online Converter.
    The html pages generated by the Converter are then run through the html_labeler
    process to create html files that are named according to the fieldname in the codebook that they are describing.</p>

<p>The purpose of this demo is to provide a landing place for the CMS Blue Button API to describe field values in the
    FHIR resources that are made available via the API.</p>

<p>Click on <strong><a href="./content/codes/index.html">This link</a></strong> to see a list of codes from the CMS Fee For Service Codebook (Version k)</p>
