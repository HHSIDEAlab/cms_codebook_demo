Chris Alleman ","Tips on Navigating the Codebook i May 2017 Tips on Navigating the Codebook This document is a detailed codebook that describes each variable in the Medicare Fee-For- Service Claims (for Version K) files. Because the files have such a large number of variables, we have included several ways for analysts to quickly find the information they need. • A complete listing of all variables in the files, in alphabetical order based on their SAS variable names. • Individual entries for each variable that contain a short description of the variable, the possible values for the variable, and, in many cases, notes that discuss how the variable was constructed and should be used. We have included hyperlinks throughout the codebook to make it easier for analysts to navigate between the table of contents and the detailed entries for the individual variables: • Clicking on any variable name in the Table of Contents will take you to the detailed description for that variable. • From the detailed description for any individual variable, clicking on the ^Back to Top^ link after each variable description will take you back to the Table of Contents.

The APC codes are used as the basis for payment for outpatient prospective payment (OPPS) service (e.g., Part B institutional). Some Part A claim types (e.g., home health and SNF) use resource groupings, which are similar to case-mix groups, as the basis for payment (e.g., HHRG, SNF RUGs). For home health (HH) claims, when the revenue center code (variable called REV_CNTR) is 0023, the HHRG is located in this field and is a HIPPS code. This field is only meaningful for a HH claim when CMS determines the claim should be paid using a different HIPPS code than the one submitted by the provider. When this happens, the revised HIPPS code (the one actually used for payment purposes) appears in this field and the original HIPPS code submitted by the provider remains in the HCPCS_CD field. Otherwise, this variable will always be null or have a value of “00000” for HH revenue center records. The resource utilization group for the particular revenue center is located in the data field called the APC or HIPPS code variable. The APC is a four byte field. The HIPPS code is a five byte field (such as 1AFKS).

The goal of the demo is to share data on quality and process innovations in an attempt to improve the care for all cardiac patients. The demonstration only affects those FIs that process claims from hospitals in Virginia and the carriers that process claims from physicians providing inpatient services at those hospitals. The hospitals will be reimbursed on a global payment basis for selected cardiac surgical diagnosis related groups (DRGs). The inpatient claims will contain a DRG '104', '105', '106', '107', '109'; the related physician/supplier claims will contain the claim payment denial reason code = 'D'.

Under HH PPS (when revenue center code equals '0023'), CMS has developed a HHA PRICER to compute the rate. On the RAP, the rate is determined using the case mix weight associated with the HIPPS code, adjusting it for the wage index for the beneficiary's site of service, then multiplying the result by 60% or 50%, depending on whether or not the RAP is for a first episode.
